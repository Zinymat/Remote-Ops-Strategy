## 🔍 The Situation (S)
The organization was facing rising administrative costs and lacked a centralized system for vendor management. Manual procurement processes led to duplicate orders and missed opportunities for bulk discounts.

## 🎯 The Task (T)
My objective was to conduct a full internal audit (ISO 9001:2015 standards) to identify waste and implement a more cost-effective procurement framework without sacrificing service quality.

## 🛠️ The Action (A)
1. **Audit & Analysis:** I reviewed three years of procurement data to identify high-spend categories.
2. **Vendor Negotiation:** I renegotiated terms with top-tier suppliers, leveraging long-term loyalty for better pricing.
3. **Digital Transformation:** I migrated legacy paper records into a digital database (Trello/Google Workspace) to track inventory in real-time.
4. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** I created a new "Procurement Guide" to ensure all team members followed the new cost-saving protocols.

## 🏆 The Result (R)
- **Financial Impact:** Reduced total administrative overhead by **35%**.
- **Accuracy:** Improved data integrity and stock tracking to **99.9%**.
- **Efficiency:** Reduced the time spent on procurement tasks by **15 hours per week** through automation.
